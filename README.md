# 03-URL-Shortener-ASP.NET
This is project 3/50 of my ASP.ENT projects series. It's a URL Shortener project that allows you to get a shorter URL for you bigger URLs.

1- when making a GET request to the root It will return all the urls that you made.

2- when making a POST request to the root it will create a new short url and return it.

3- when making a GET request to /:shortUrl it will return an object with the full URL so you redirect on the front-end.
